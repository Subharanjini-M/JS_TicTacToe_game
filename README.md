# JS_TicTacToe_game

Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 3x3 grid where two players, the human and the computer, take turns marking their respective symbols (X for the human player and O for the computer) in the grid cells. The objective is to get three of your marks in a row—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before your opponent does.
